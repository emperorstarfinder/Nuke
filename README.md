# VoxSim
VoxSim is an attempt to make a 3D voxel simulator using both CUDA and OpenGL for the scientific computation and rendering respectively. It's also going to allow simulations to be described by the user, or to be created simply, so that it can be used academically by people who don't have the required coding knowledge.
